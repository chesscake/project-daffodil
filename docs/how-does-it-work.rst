How does it all work?
======================

As Mysterious Messenger is the result of over 4 years of work (the past two of which have included daily updates), it now has a rather hefty amount of code, much of which is tailored to be easy-to-use from the front end. That can mean that it's hard to get your head around how it's doing all the "behind the scenes" stuff. This page is intended to walk you through some of the thought processes behind the various parts of Mysterious Messenger, and show examples of simplified versions of the classes and systems that make up the inner workings of the project.
