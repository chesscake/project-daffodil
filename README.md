# Project Daffodil

A visual novel with a story mode called "New Story" which branches off in routes for Vanderwood and Rika. The scripts are entirely fan made and take place 11 days before the 2nd party with the player working alongside Rika as a party coordinator. 

### Synopsys 

New Story takes place before Rika's full descent into Savior, shortly before the 2nd RFA party when she was still with the RFA.
In this timeline she mistakenly invites MC as a guest for the upcoming party but through her email exchange she feels a strong connection and offers to meet up with MC weeks before the party is due.
Once they meet, Rika connection with MC deepens as both share the same ideals of aiding marginalized people and the elderly. Thus Rika invites MC to join the RFA as a member!

The game starts 11 days before the 2nd party with MC as the 2nd party coordinator...
