# Project Daffodil

A visual novel with a story mode called "New Story" which branches off in routes for Vanderwood and Rika. The scripts are entirely fan made and take place 11 days before the 2nd party with the player working alongside Rika as a party coordinator. 

### Synopsys 

New Story takes place before Rika's full descent into Savior, shortly before the 2nd RFA party when she was still with the RFA.
In this timeline she mistakenly invites MC as a guest for the upcoming party but through her email exchange she feels a strong connection and offers to meet up with MC weeks before the party is due.
Once they meet, Rika connection with MC deepens as both share the same ideals of aiding marginalized people and the elderly. Thus Rika invites MC to join the RFA as a member!

The game starts 11 days before the 2nd party with MC as the 2nd party coordinator...

## Getting Started

* If you want to run this code, you will need to download the Ren'Py engine: [https://www.renpy.org/](https://www.renpy.org/)
* As of 2021-05-28 (the time of this update) the version of Ren'Py used is 7.4.5.
* Download or clone the [most recent release](https://github.com/shawna-p/mysterious-messenger/releases) into your Ren'Py Projects Directory and unzip it into its own folder. If you don't know what it is, you can change it from the Ren'Py launcher via `preferences -> Projects Directory`.
* Refresh your Projects list and you should see `mysterious-messenger` listed
* Save the Script Generator spreadsheet somewhere you can find it later
* **The images and sound files used in this project are not included in the repository. Please contact me directly if you would like to request the assets for personal use.**

### Getting the Program Running

If you've set up everything properly, from the Ren'Py Launcher you should be able to select the project you created from the column on the left and hit 'Launch Project'. If you don't have the images/sound files, you will likely run into several "not found" errors until you've created your own replacements; otherwise, you should be able to go ahead and type in your desired name for the protagonist and check out the "Tutorial Day", which will walk you through some of the available features in the program.

### Creating your own chatrooms

Included in the repository is a file called Script Generator.xlsx. The repository also includes a wiki which contains most of the information you'll need to get started. The spreadsheet file has an instruction tab and a several templates to facilitate turning dialogue into readable code for the program. Once you've filled out the template sheet correctly, you can simply copy-paste the code into the program and add in any outstanding features, such as choice menus or background music.
